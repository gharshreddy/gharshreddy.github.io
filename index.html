			 <li>1 cup rice ~ 200gm</li>
			 <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
			 <li>2 to 3 tbs Ghee
				 <ul>
					 <li>This is nothing but clarified butter. We need to heat butter in a pan until it turns slighlty golden yet transparent.

			 <ol>
				 <li>
					Wash rice in cold water and let it soak in it for 20 mins.

			 <ol>
				 <li>
					To the the boiling milk add the rice and keep stiring. Make sure that no lumps are formed. 
				 </li>
				 <li>
					Now after string for a couple of minutes the rice should turn very soft and mushy. Keep string until it is very soft. Then mash it a little with the spatula.
				 </li>
				 <li>
					Adjust the consistancy by adding more milk if you like it a little watery. But a typical Paravannam is quite thick.
